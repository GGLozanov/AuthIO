# AuthIO
A small Android client app designed to implement authentication through consummation of a PHP and MySQL Web service hosted on a local machine and accessed through a public WAN IP on port 8080. Using a WAMP (Apache+MySQL+PHP bundle) as a server to host said service, along with the Retrofit client for translating HTTP responses to applicable Java classes, a baseline REST API is simulated.

Requires specific environment variables referenced in code to be configured with Gradle in order for the project to build securely and well. If you wish to contribute, contact the dev for access and other preliminary configurations.
