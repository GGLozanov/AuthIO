# AuthIO
A small Android client app designed to implement authentication through consummation of a PHP and MySQL Web service hosted on a local machine and accessed through a public WAN IP on port 8080. Using a WAMP (Apache+MySQL+PHP bundle) as a server to host said service, along with the Retrofit client for translating HTTP responses to applicable Java classes, a baseline REST API is simulated.
